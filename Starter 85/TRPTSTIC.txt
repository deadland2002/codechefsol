Problem:
K students and one mentor want to stay in a hotel that has an N' x M' rooms, arranged in NV rows and M columns. 
The room at the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column can accommodate Aij people, and the mentor can stay in the same room as a student. 
The distance between two rooms (1,1) and (zz, yo) is max(|i - z|, |j - y|). 
Find the minimum possible distance between the mentor's room and the farthest student's room.

Explanation:
First, if the sum of all Aij is less than K, then it's impossible to accommodate K + 1 people in the hotel, so the answer is -1. 
Otherwise, a valid answer always exists. Suppose we fix which room the mentor is staying in, say (z, y). 
Note that this is only possible when Aij is not equal to 0. Suppose we also fix the maximum allowed distance D between the mentor and a student. 
Notice that with these two constraints, the set of cells where students are allowed to stay forms a rectangular subgrid of size 4. 
Specifically, we want all cells (i, j) such that max(|z - i|, |y - j|) < D. This means |i - z| < D and |j - y| < D. 
From the definition of absolute value, this means -D < z - i < D and -D < y - j < D. 
Rearranging this gives us a range of i and j, forming the rectangle [z - D, z + D] x [y - D, y + D]. 
In particular, if K + 1 people can be fit into this rectangle, then it's possible for the maximum distance to be at most D. 
Checking whether K + 1 people fit into this rectangle is simple to do in O(1) after some precomputation. 
Notice that we only want the sum of all values in the specified rectangle. 
This is doable with 2D prefix sums, a tutorial can be found here.

We are now able to quickly check, for a fixed (z, y) and D, whether a maximum distance of less than D is possible. 
However, there are N x M possible cells (z, y) and up to max(N, M) values of D for each of them, so going through them all would still be too slow. 
However, notice that if we're able to achieve a maximum distance of less than D, then of course we can achieve a maximum distance of less than D + 1. 
So, we only need to find the smallest D such that there exists some cell (z, y) which satisfies the condition. 
This is exactly what binary search does! That gives us the following solution:

Binary search on the value of D, from 0 to max(N, M).
For a fixed value of D, go through all cells (z, y) such that Aij is not equal to 0, and check whether any of them allow for a maximum distance of less than D, using 2D prefix sums as discussed above. 
For a fixed value of D, this takes O(NM) time.
Since we're applying binary search, we check only O(log max(N, M)) values of D, for a solution that's O(NM log max(N, M)).
Time Complexity: O(NM log max(N, M)) per test case.
