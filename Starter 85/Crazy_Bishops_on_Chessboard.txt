PROBLEM:
There's an N x N chessboard with 4 bishops on it.
Initially, the bishops are at positions (1,1), (2,2), (1,3), (2,4), (1,5),...
You want their final positions to be (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)...
What's the minimum number of moves needed to achieve this?

EXPLANATION:
If N <= 2, the answer is 0 because the first 2 bishops are already in the required positions.
For N > 2, a strategy can be derived as follows:

For each bishop that's initially on (2, k), use one move to bring it to the required diagonal.
Then, for each bishop that's initially on (1, k), use two moves to bring it to the required diagonal.
This strategy would take a + 2b moves, where a is the number of bishops initially on the second row (that need to be moved), and b is the number of bishops initially on the first row (that need to be moved).
In fact, this is optimal!
Proof:
It's not necessary to simplify this into a formula based on N.
If N = 1, the answer is 0.
If N is odd, the answer is Yes.
If N is even, the answer is N-2.
TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(1) per test case.
